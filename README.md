# Portfolio Website

A minimal, engineer-centric personal portfolio and blog.

## Local Development

### Option 1: Direct File Access
Simply open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

### Option 2: Localhost Server (Recommended)
To test on `localhost`, you can use Python (which is already installed):
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run: `python -m http.server 8000`
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
If you use VS Code, install the **Live Server** extension. Click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner to start a server and watch for changes automatically.
